## 開發過程與挑戰 | Development Process and Challenges

During the development process, we encountered challenges integrating Firebase for real-time messaging, particularly ensuring system stability with multiple users interacting simultaneously. In addition to implementing basic chat functions, we also integrated Face Time for video calling, which required handling several APIs and UI interactions. The project also focused on user experience, making it easy for users to find job vacancies, ask programming questions, and participate in competitions through a straightforward registration process and intuitive interface design.
